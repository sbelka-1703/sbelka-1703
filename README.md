# Welcome to Sbelka's GitHub Profile 👋


Hi there! I'm a self-taught frontend developer who left a career of medicine to pursue and discover the frontier of Web3. 

I am now a full-time member of the talented team at Eden Protocol 🌱 , where I specialize in creating intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive components. My expertise lies in utilizing the latest web technologies such as TypeScript, Tailwind, Next.js and to bring innovative ideas to life. 

I'm always eager to expand my skill set and tackle new challenges.




## What I am currently doing: 
- 👨‍💻 Contributing to Eden Protocol Fulltime 
- 🧪 Becoming a better frontend tester with Jest and RTL
- 🤖 Building my first fullstack component with OpenAI API
